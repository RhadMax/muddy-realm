//function for entering custom statistic values, current plan is it takes in the res from the first prompt where user selects name/race/age, then asks about stats one by one. Ideally it shows the total number of stat points left to allocate but unsure how inquirer can do that unless it chains a number of functions together, one for each stat, and maybe also even recursively calls itself untill the user selects a prompt to move on to next statistic. In that case it could maybe build an array up as it goes, passing it along from function to function as it chains along. Each function adjusting the stat value corresponding to an index in the statbuilder array, using inquirer prompts/responses. Each prompt could display the array (or object?) so the user has a look at their progress in building up their stats.  ---OR --- duh, make a function inside the inquirer prompt that displays current stats, remaining total, and user can select from list to increase/decrease each stat
