Zone Concepts:

Northern regions:

Starter - Tallow Key - Small village set alongside a river running down out of the northern mountain ranges. Temperate/cold region where the winters run long and wildlife thrives just beyond the reach of settled lands. Little lay upriver, forests and lumber are fairly plentiful and farming is mediocre at best. The mainstays of the region are hardy crops like onions, garlic and peas along with livestock such as cattle and sheep, especially sheep due to the added benefit of the fleece they yield. The village gets it name from the abundant amount of tallow produced by the farmers of the region, which in tandem with the fast flowing river that passes through the village, provides the townsfolk with a means of income with the occasional trading ship that makes its way down the flow and sells off the excess to the larger township of Rushlight Crossing (which also owes it namesake to the candles commonly made from the tallow). A few hardy folk make their living ferrying goods down river from Tallow Key to Rushlight, using the currents to glide the hauls down quickly, then making the arduous trip back upriver using poles and pushing along the shallows. Sometimes merchants from Rushlight earn double by offering to haul the narrow boats back up to Tallow's Key strapped to the tops of their caravans, also hauling odds ands ends back up north for the country folk to purchase.

Abbatoir (name for building where animals are slaughtered, french origin), -- Abbatoir Road - Narrow road, narrow and mostly unfit for any sizable cart that winds near the river stemming northward from Tallow Key. Hard packed dirt, slightly rocky, fallen into disuse but shows signs of old use with how low it is set into the earth, though grass now fights to reclaim the hard soil. The occasional low stone wall, mostly collapsed as often as not, shows signs of farmsteads that used to cling to life in the progressively harder climates heading toward the mountains. A few families still cling to their old family lands, tending their flocks and eeking a living out of meager harvests, combined with trade down in Tallow's Key for whatever food they cannot provide themselves.

Mountains (name?) -- wolves, bears??
