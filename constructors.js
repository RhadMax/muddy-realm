Upon changing gear that index will be sliced out into temporary variable and then either placed in inventory/at ground or if 'empty (undefined??)' then no action --- this depends on specific index, tougher to implement but may work with default empty gear for each slot that fills indexes, less scalable

    //other idea would be to make equipment an array of indeterminate length that can be empty if need be, and every item has a slot parameter, upon changing gear it compares slot of item being equipped to every item in equipped array, if another item in array has same slot value then the equipped item is taken out of array before new item is added in. tricky bit is 1h vs 2h weapons, or shields vs 2h weapons... will address later
