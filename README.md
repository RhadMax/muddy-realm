# Muddy Realm (WIP / Concept)

Early exploration for a terminal-based RPG in Node.js.

This repo is a **concept + scaffolding** project: notes, rough structure, and early entity modeling (constructors) while experimenting with game state and branching narrative.

## Status
Not a complete or runnable game (yet). Kept here as a reference for future iteration.

## What’s here
- early data/model sketches
- initial constructors / entities
- folder structure experiments
- whiteboarding notes on mechanics and flow

## If revisited
Next steps would be:
- define a minimal playable loop (start → choice → encounter → outcome)
- implement state management for player/inventory
- add a single encounter path end-to-end
